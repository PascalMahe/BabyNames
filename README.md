## Description

DataVisualisation course (IGR204 @ Télécom Paris) mini-project.

The goal is:

"goal is to create 3 different visualizations around these data, each focussed on answering different kinds of questions about the data:

    Visualization 1: How do baby names evolve over time? Are there names that have consistently remained popular or unpopular? Are there some that have were suddenly or briefly popular or unpopular? Are there trends in time?
    Visualization 2: Is there a regional effect in the data? Are some names more popular in some regions? Are popular names generally popular across the whole country?
    Visualization 3: Are there gender effects in the data? Does popularity of names given to both sexes evolve consistently? (Note: this data set treats sex as binary; this is a simplification that carries into this assignment but does not generally hold.)
"

In order to run each visualisation, simply run the cells in the corresponding notebook. Once the graph is available you can interact with it.
The graphs 1 and 3 both need to input a name in order to work, you can enter "jean" or "michel" for example.
For visualisation 1, input names in lowercase and separated by ";", "jean;luc;lucien" is an example.
